# Project Overview

Project Name: "Cosmic Greeting"

Description: A single-page "Hello World" application designed to showcase the speed and simplicity of the Cloudflare next-on-pages framework. This isn't just any greeting; it's a dynamically generated message from a simulated interstellar probe!

Features:

*   Dynamic Greeting: The main component displays "Hello World!" followed by a randomly generated codename for a fictional space probe (e.g., "Hello World! - Sent by Probe: Voyager Alpha").
*   Subtle Animation: A subtle, starfield background animation adds visual polish without impacting performance.
*   Responsive Design: Ensures the greeting is perfectly legible on any device.

Target Audience: Developers looking for a quick and elegant starting point for Cloudflare next-on-pages projects.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS)
*   JavaScript for dynamic codename generation and animation.
*   CSS for styling and responsiveness.

Specifics:

*   The single component ("CosmicGreeting.js") will handle the generation of the probe codename and the display of the greeting.
*   The animation will be implemented using CSS keyframes for optimal performance.
